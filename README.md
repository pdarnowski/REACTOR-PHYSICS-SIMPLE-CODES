Revision 24-09-2018, Piotr Darnowski, piotr.darnowski@itc.pw.edu.pl

It is a suite of simple computer codes to study the basics of Nuclear Reactor Physics.
All codes/scripts were written in MATLAB environment.
The package indluces: diffusion 1D/0D codes, single and multigroup, point burnup calculations, point neutron kinetics and dynamics and point Xenon & Samarium transients.
The package was published initially 22-07-2017 at GitLab, it is still under development.
A suite of computer codes to study the basics of Nuclear Reactor Physics. Includ: diffusion 1D/0D codes, single and multigroup, point burnup calculations, point neutron kinetics and dynamics and point Xenon &amp; Samarium transients.
